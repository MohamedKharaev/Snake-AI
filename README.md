# Snake-AI

Instructions for running the Snake neural network:

1. Install any version of Python 3, up to and including Python 3.7. Python 3.8 or later is not supported with this program.
2. Install NumPy, PyGame, and TensorFlow. Note that the TensorFlow version must be 1.15. After installing TensorFlow, install tflearn.
3. Open SnakeNN.py and run it in order to train the agent. Then, once it stops running, comment out SnakeNN().train() and uncomment SnakeNN().show_game() to show how the agent plays Snake after training.
